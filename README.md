# Ry3s_Vimrc
Just a place for me to stick my Vim settings file (a constant work in progress)

If you know about cool Vim things like settings, plugins, whatever.. let me know!

HINT: remember to run these commands to make it work right..

sudo apt-get install vim (if Vim not installed)

git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim (if Vundle not installed)

open Vim and type :PluginInstall at the bottom bar then hit enter!
